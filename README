This is my Chess Engine Repo

In it I've built an OOP chess program with a GUI, sound, full move validation

I've also built one chess engine that utilizes bitboard, and advanced algorithms.

Currently, I'm making my second iteration of a bitboard chess engine, since the first one I decided to learn by trying to architect it myself, leading to me learning a lot about how chess engines work, but creating a lot of tech debt and issues surrounding testing.
